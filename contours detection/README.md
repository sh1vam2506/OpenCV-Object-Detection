# Contour Detection with OpenCV

This project is real-time contour detection application using OpenCV and Python. The program captures video from your webcam, processes the frames to detect contours, and displays the contours along with some additional information like the number of points and the area of the detected contours. The program was developed for SHAD 2023 Design Challenge.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from webcam.
- Adjustable parameters for Canny edge detection and contour area using trackbars.
- Displays contours and bounding rectangles around detected objects.
- Shows the number of points in the contour and the area of the contour.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Keyboard module

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/contour-detection-opencv.git
    cd contour-detection-opencv
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy opencv-python keyboard
    ```

## Usage

Run the following command to start the contour detection:
```bash
python contour_detection.py
